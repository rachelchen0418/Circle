# Circle
## Our Mission
Circle encourages communities to decrease the amount of secondhand (but still useful!) items that get sent to landfills and recycling centers by prioritizing reusing over recycling. According to the EPA, over 13 million tons of textiles are trashed every year, even though nearly half of it is perfectly reusable. This is a statistic concerning only clothing, so just imagine vast amount of items being wasted overall.

## What We Do
Circle serves as a middleman that will connect users who have items they no longer want to other users and nonÂ­profit organizations that would like to make use of the secondhand items. Users will post items that they no longer need on the web application, making it public to all users to view and request. Once a request is made, the user who posted the item would be notified and the two parties would be set up to figure out a time and place to meet.
